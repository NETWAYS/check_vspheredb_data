# README

`check_vspheredb_data` is a check plugin for checking performance data gathered by the [Icingaweb2 vSphereDB module](https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2-module-vspheredb)
against given thresholds written in Go. It is a rewrite of [an older version](https://github.com/NETWAYS/vspheredb-data-check) written in Rust, utilizing the [go-check](https://github.com/NETWAYS/go-check) SDK for monitoring plugins for better maintainability.

It allows for finegrained monitoring of ESXI hosts on Icinga2's side without the need to configure alerting on
the vCenters' side as vSphereDB's inbuilt mechanisms do.
